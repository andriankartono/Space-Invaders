# Space-Invaders

A code for the popular arcade game Space-Invaders, coded in python with the implementation of pygames.
This Code is created as my first project to learn about game development using pygames.

Instructions:
Use the left and right arrow key to move the spaceship!
Use spacebar to shoot down the enemies and try to get a good score!
Prevent the enemy from getting too close to your spaceship or it is game over!
Have Fun and Enjoy the game!
